heme,TLR2,synergistic ,28646881,"In this study, we showed for the first time that heme molecules released from hematomas function as endogenous agonists of astrocyte TLR2 and induce MMP9 activation, thereby leading to BBB damage and secondary brain injury after ICH."
heme,"TLR3, TLR7, TLR9",synergistic ,20617898,"As previously reported, we found that hemin alone weakly but significantly enhanced production of TNF (data not shown) [24]. Hemin synergized with LPS (Figure 5A), poly I:C (Figure 5B), and loxoribine (Figure 5C). We also found that the synergy of hemin with poly I:C and loxoribine was not TLR4 dependent (Figure 5B and 5C) and that synergy with LPS was partially but not completely MyD88 dependent (Figure 5D and 5E). Of note, we did not find any hemin synergy with Pam3Cys and CpG DNA, although a large range of hemin chloride concentrations (0.01 to ~30 ����mol/L)"
